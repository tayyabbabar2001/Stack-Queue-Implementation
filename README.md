# Stack-Queue-Implementation
Implementation of Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) data structures with basic operations. Includes sorting a stack using two stacks and simulating stack behavior using two queues. Demonstrates data abstraction and object-oriented programming concepts.

Data Structures Project - Stack, Queue, Stack Sorting & Queue-Based Stack

This project demonstrates the implementation of essential data structures and their extended functionalities using object-oriented programming principles. The main goal is to restrict direct access to the underlying data and provide controlled operations only.

✅ Implemented Features

1️⃣ **Stack Implementation (LIFO)**
- Custom Stack class using a list of characters
- Supports the following operations:
  - `Constructor()`
  - `Push()` - Insert an element at the top
  - `Pop()` - Remove and return the top element
  - `GetTop()` - Get the top element without removing it
  - `IsEmpty()` - Check if the stack is empty
  - `IsFull()` - Check if the stack is full
  - `GetSize()` - Return current stack size
  - `PrintStack()` - Display stack contents

---

2️⃣ **Queue Implementation (FIFO)**
- Custom Queue class using a list of characters
- Supports the following operations:
  - `Constructor()`
  - `Enqueue()` - Insert an element at the end
  - `Dequeue()` - Remove and return the front element
  - `Front()` - Get the front element without removing it
  - `IsEmpty()` - Check if the queue is empty
  - `IsFull()` - Check if the queue is full
  - `GetSize()` - Return current queue size
  - `PrintQueue()` - Display queue contents

---

3️⃣ **Stack Sorting using Two Stacks**
- Implementation of sorting a stack using only two stack objects

---

4️⃣ **Stack Functionality using Two Queues**
- Implementation of a stack's `Push()` and `Pop()` operations using two queue objects
